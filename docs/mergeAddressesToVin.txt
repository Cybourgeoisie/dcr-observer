Features Needed:
- Address search: all inputs, outputs, txes, activity block times & dates, current values
- Transaction search: all inputs, outputs, votes
- Block search: all txes, inputs, outputs

A database sounds really necessary at this point. However, we can start simple...

- For all vin's, we need the addresses. Currently, we need to do a search. Let's fix that.
- Reduce O(n^2) time to O(n)
- Iterate over all blocks from 0 to current, when come across a vin, get the vout address and store it
	- As I saw, there MIGHT be duplicates, so store in an array

vout -> "scriptPubKey" -> addresses array

if (!vin[i].hasOwnProperty('vout')) {
	vin[i].vout = [];
}

vin[i].vout.push({
	addresses: vout[j].scriptPubKey.addresses,
	blockheight: ,
	tree: ,
	blockindex: ,
	vout: ,
});

// Now save the vin back to the file

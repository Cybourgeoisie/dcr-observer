Todo:
X Clear liquid and active_stake_submissions again, then recalculate

Open Questions:
- Why negative balances?
X Any negative vouts or vins?
X After redoing everything, are we still getting bad liquids or stake submissions?
X Why is Dcur2 not matching liquids and balance?
- Are there any Dc* wallets that DON'T have two sets of sstxcommitments?
- Are there any Ds* wallets that DO have two sets of sstxcommitments?

If the balances look kosher, then we STANDARDIZE IT and move the fuck along.

New Todo:
X Replace all balances with address_summary_view
X Replace all hd_network with network_summary_view
X Fix the network creation SQL to capture EVERYTHING
	- Almost everything. It's much better.
- Finish migrating everything to views, get rid of old tables
	X balance & balance_rank
	- tx_network
	- hd_network
	X drop network column from address (alter table address drop column network;)
X Implement vout_details in a materialized view
